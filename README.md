# BSAN-6070-CA03-Decision_Tree_Algorithm
# Decision Tree Classification Model

In this Computer Assignment we create a Decision Tree Classifier algorithm in order to forecast the income levels based off of certain predictor inputs. It uses attributes like occupation, marriage & relationship status, age and more to predict whether an individual will make over/under $50,000.

# Dataset

The data set can be downloaded via github and loaded as follows:
url = 'https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/blob/main/CA03/census_data.csv?raw=true'
data = pd.read_csv(url, encoding = "ISO-8859-1")


# Code

Python Notebook: 
Is loaded in this repository. The file name is:\
'BSAN-6070 CA03_Census_Data_Mfolozi_Dlamini_20Feb.ipynb'

# Instructions on how to launch
1) Open the python notebook on google colab.
2)  Import Modules
3)  Read CSV file
url = 'https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/blob/main/CA03/census_data.csv?raw=true'
data = pd.read_csv(url, encoding = "ISO-8859-1")
4) Run the Code\
    a) for running the automation model you will have to load the data file included in this repository:\
    'auto_testing_mfolozi_20feb.csv' also included in this repository\
    b)then run the code for automation model (#8)
